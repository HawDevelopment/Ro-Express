# Installation

I recommend using Rojo, as its where the power of Ro-Express really shines. Its also best used with git.
Also, you should update the module to new versions regularly.

**Roblox Studio:**

-   Get the Module from the [Library](https://www.roblox.com/library/7008961783/Ro-Express) or from [github realeases](https://github.com/HawDevelopment/Ro-Express/releases).
-   Place the Module within ReplicatedStorage.

**Rojo workflow:**

-   Download the Ro-Express from the latest [release](https://github.com/HawDevelopment/Ro-Express/releases).
-   Extract the Module from the zipped file.
-   Place the Module in ReplicatedStorage.

**Git workflow:**

-   Run `git submodule add https://github.com/HawDevelopment/Ro-Express.git`
-   Point the Submodule folder to ReplicatedStorage using Rojo.

**[Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally) workflow:**

-   Add `express = "hawdevelopment/express"` to your `wally.toml`
